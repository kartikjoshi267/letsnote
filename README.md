# **Let'sNote ![image](/public/favicon.ico)**

This is my first **M E R N** project which is a note-taking application in which:

* you can create new users,
* log in to your account,
* retrieve all your notes
* add a new note
* update an existing note
* delete a note

___

The **frontend development** has been done by using javascript libraries such as *react*, *react-bootstrap*, *react-icons*, and *bootstrap*.

<br>

The **backend development** has been done using *NodeJS* - *Express* package. Also, the npm packages like bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken are also used.
